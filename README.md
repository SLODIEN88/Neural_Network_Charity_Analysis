# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Deep Learning module
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. We received the dataset from Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, which contained more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. We used the TensorFlow platfrom to classify the success of charitable donations. 


## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

## Data Preprocessing
- The columns EIN and NAME are identification information and have been removed from the input data.
- Columns: APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT are the features for the model.
- We encoded the categorical variables, split them into training and testing datasets

## Summary: 
The deep learning module did not reach the 75% as wanted. The highest it could go was 72%. With this, the module is not outperforming. To make sure we get the desired results, we could use a supervised machine learning model like the Random Forest Classifier. This will help us evaulate it against our depp learning model.
